# Contributing to This Project

The contributors are listed in AUTHORS (add yourself). This project uses the MPL v2 license, see LICENSE.

Please read carefully BEFORE you send a patch:

* This project uses the [C4.1 (Collective Code Construction Contract)](http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:22) process for contributions. Please read this if you are unfamiliar with it.

Each patch defines one clear and agreed problem, and one clear, minimal, plausible solution. 

We will usually merge patches aggressively, without a blocking review. If you send us bad patches, without taking the care to read and understand our rules, that reflects on you. Do NOT expect us to do your homework for you.

As rapidly we will merge poor quality patches, we will remove them again. If you insist on arguing about this and trying to justify your changes, we will simply ignore you and your patches. If you still insist, we will ban you.
